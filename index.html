  <h1>AKAN NAMES</h1>
  <p>Akan names are a naming system found in Ghanian culture. As with most African cultures, names are given according to significant events such as the day of the week or time of day the child was born. When it comes to Akan names, the day of the week on which the child is born determines the name of the child. The names are also dependent on gender of the child. Below is a list of names for boys alongside the day of the week they are born:</p>
